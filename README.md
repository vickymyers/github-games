The object of this game is to stack the pieces such that they form a complete row of squares.
If the pieces are allowed to stack to the top of the screen, the game is over.
When a full row is formed, the row disappears.

From your fork of the github-games repo, click the URL in the repo description.
From the game page, click the space bar, to make the pieces start dropping.
Use the left- and right-arrow keys to move the pieces horizontally.
Use the up-arrow key to rotate the pieces.
