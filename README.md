## Welcome to GitHub Games

A project based learning activity for people who are getting started with Git and GitHub.

You can play the game at: http://githubschool.github.io/vickymyer-games/

Here is how you play the game:
1. Press the space bar to get started.
2. Press the up arrow to rotate the shape.
3. The goal is to create complete rows with no empty spaces.
4. Don't let the pieces stack up too high!

The object of this game is to stack the pieces such that they form a complete row of squares.
If the pieces are allowed to stack to the top of the screen, the game is over.
When a full row is formed, the row disappears.

From your fork of the github-games repo, click the URL in the repo description.
From the game page, click the space bar, to make the pieces start dropping.
Use the left- and right-arrow keys to move the pieces horizontally.
Use the up-arrow key to rotate the pieces.
